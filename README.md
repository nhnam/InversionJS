# InversionJS
Practice Dependency inversion principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)

### The principle states
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces).
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
